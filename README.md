# Welcome to Dalle_clone!


## 💡 Concept
A fullstack (MERN) web app based on OpenAI API, allowing to create, post and download AI generated (DALL-E) pictures based on text prompts.
 
## 🔍 Project overview 
The app allows users to create AI generated pictures (1024x1024) based on text prompts. On homepage there is a display of all generated pictures. From homepage user can download any picture. 
On "create-post" page user can create picture based on custom prompts or choose a random prompt from a ready base of sample prompts.
Pictures are stored in cloudinary account and MongoDB stores data to post and get the prompts.
The app has light and dark mode, depending on user preference.

For it to work, one has to configure .env file in server directory and add their own:
- OpenAI API KEY
- MongoDB database link with credentials
- Cloudinary name, key and secret
